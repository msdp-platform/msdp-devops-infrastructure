# Cleanup Completed - Removed Files

The following files/directories were removed during the cleanup process:

## Removed Directories
- `tobedelete/` - Contained archived files no longer needed

## Deprecated Actions
- `.github/actions/terraform-backend/` - Marked as deprecated, use `terraform-backend-enhanced` instead

## Files Cleaned Up
- `tobedelete/aks-manual-deploy.yaml` - Archived workflow file

## Next Steps
After testing the new implementation, the deprecated terraform-backend action can be safely removed.
