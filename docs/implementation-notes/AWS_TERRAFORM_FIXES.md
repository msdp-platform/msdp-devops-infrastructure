# AWS Terraform Fixes Applied

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

The AWS network pipeline was failing due to several Terraform configuration issues. Here are the fixes applied:

### 1. **Duplicate `required_providers` Configuration**
**Issue**: Both `main.tf` and `versions.tf` had `required_providers` blocks, causing conflicts.

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate `terraform` block from `main.tf`, keeping only the one in `versions.tf`.

```hcl
# REMOVED from main.tf:
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

# KEPT in versions.tf (correct location)
```

### 2. **Missing Backend Configuration**
**Issue**: Terraform was warning about missing backend configuration.

**Fix**: Added S3 backend configuration to both network and EKS modules.

```hcl
# ADDED to main.tf:
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    # Backend configuration will be provided via -backend-config
  }
}
```

### 3. **Invalid Component Name in Configuration**
**Issue**: The `generate-backend-config.py` script was rejecting `network` as a valid AWS component.

**Fix**: Updated `config/global/naming.yaml` to include `network` as a valid AWS component.

```yaml
# ADDED to naming.yaml:
components:
  aws:
    - network  # ← Added this
    - vpc
    - eks
    # ... other components
```

## ✅ Files Modified

### 1. **AWS Network Module**
- **`infrastructure/environment/aws/network/main.tf`**:
  - Removed duplicate `terraform` block
  - Added S3 backend configuration

### 2. **AWS EKS Module**  
- **`infrastructure/environment/aws/eks/main.tf`**:
  - Added S3 backend configuration

### 3. **Global Configuration**
- **`config/global/naming.yaml`**:
  - Added `network` as valid AWS component

## 🚀 Expected Results

With these fixes, the AWS network pipeline should now:

1. ✅ **Pass Terraform validation** - No more syntax errors
2. ✅ **Generate backend configuration** - Valid component name
3. ✅ **Initialize Terraform** - Proper backend configuration
4. ✅ **Plan/Apply successfully** - Clean Terraform execution

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Re-run the AWS Network Workflow**:
   ```bash
   GitHub Actions → aws-network.yml → action=plan
   ```

2. **Verify the fixes**:
   - Backend configuration generation should succeed
   - Terraform init should complete without errors
   - Terraform plan should show the network resources

3. **Deploy the network**:
   ```bash
   GitHub Actions → aws-network.yml → action=apply
   ```

## 📋 Validation Checklist

- ✅ No duplicate `required_providers` blocks
- ✅ Backend configuration present in all modules
- ✅ Valid component names in global configuration
- ✅ Proper Terraform syntax throughout
- ✅ Consistent file structure with Azure modules

The AWS infrastructure should now deploy successfully! 🎉
