# Repository Cleanup Summary

**Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Purpose**: Clean up repository by archiving legacy files and removing duplicates

## What Was Cleaned Up

### 1. Legacy CI/CD Workflows
**Location**: `ci-cd/workflows/` → `archive/legacy-workflows/`
- `deploy-backstage.yml`
- `deploy-infrastructure.yml`
- `deploy-platform-components.yml`
- `manage-secrets.yml`
- `test-backstage.yml`

**Reason**: These workflows were replaced by the new modular configuration-driven pipeline in `.github/workflows/deploy-modular.yml`.

### 2. External DNS Policy Files
**Location**: Root directory → `archive/external-dns-policies/`
- `external-dns-policy.json`
- `external-dns-trust-policy-fixed.json`
- `external-dns-trust-policy-updated.json`
- `external-dns-trust-policy.json`

**Reason**: These policies are now managed through the modular pipeline and infrastructure configuration.

### 3. Backup Files
**Location**: Various → `archive/backup-files/`
- Multiple `.backup.20250908_*` and `.backup.20250909_*` files
- Created during the transition to modular pipeline architecture

**Reason**: Temporary backup files created during development and testing.

### 4. Outdated Documentation
**Location**: `docs/` → `archive/outdated-docs/`
- `Week1-Development-Environment-Status.md`
- `Week1-Progress-Summary.md`
- `infrastructure/README-Consolidated.md`
- `infrastructure/README-Smart-Deployment.md`

**Reason**: Outdated status reports and duplicate README files.

### 5. Legacy Files
**Removed**:
- `kustomize` (legacy kustomize file)
- `ci-cd/` directory (now empty)

## Current Repository Structure

```
├── .github/
│   ├── actions/           # Reusable GitHub Actions
│   ├── components.yml     # Component registry
│   └── workflows/         # Active workflows
├── archive/               # Archived legacy files
├── docs/                  # Current documentation
├── infrastructure/        # Infrastructure configurations
├── scripts/               # Utility scripts
└── README.md             # Main documentation
```

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed 23+ legacy files
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of active vs archived files
3. **Better Organization**: Logical directory structure
4. **Historical Preservation**: All files archived, not deleted
5. **Focused Documentation**: Removed outdated status reports

## Archive Policy

- All archived files are preserved in the `archive/` directory
- Each archive subdirectory has a clear purpose
- Archive README documents what was archived and why
- Files can be restored if needed for historical reference

## Next Steps

1. The repository is now clean and organized
2. Focus on maintaining the modular pipeline architecture
3. Regular cleanup of temporary files during development
4. Archive outdated documentation as the project evolves
