## üéØ **Key Benefits**

### **Team Autonomy**
- **Independent Development**: Each team owns their repository and can work independently
- **Technology Freedom**: Teams can choose appropriate technologies for their domain
- **Release Cycles**: Independent release and deployment cycles
- **Ownership**: Clear ownership and accountability

### **Scalability**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Easy to add new teams and repositories
- **Service Scaling**: Independent scaling of services based on demand
- **Team Scaling**: Easy to onboard new team members to specific domains
- **Geographic Scaling**: Support for distributed teams

### **Maintainability**
- **Focused Codebases**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to maintain
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined service boundaries reduce complexity
- **Reduced Coupling**: Loose coupling between services and repositories
- **Easier Debugging**: Easier to debug and troubleshoot specific domains

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Access Control**: Granular access control per repository
- **Security Scanning**: Focused security scanning and compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Clear audit trails per repository
- **Compliance**: Easier compliance management per domain
