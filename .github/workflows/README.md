# MSDP DevOps Infrastructure - GitHub Actions Workflows

## 🎯 **Workflow Architecture Overview**

This directory contains **9 focused, production-ready workflows** organized in a three-tier architecture after comprehensive refactoring and cleanup.

## 📋 **Workflow Inventory**

### **🚀 Orchestration Layer** (2 workflows)
Advanced orchestration workflows with intelligent dependency management:

1. **`infrastructure-orchestrator.yml`** - Master orchestration workflow
   - Intelligent dependency resolution
   - Parallel execution of independent components
   - Phased deployment strategy
   - Comprehensive status reporting

2. **`environment-promotion.yml`** - Environment promotion workflow
   - Configuration diff analysis
   - Validation gates and manual approval
   - Automated issue creation and tracking
   - Cross-environment deployment automation

### **🏗️ Infrastructure Layer** (4 workflows)
Consolidated infrastructure deployment workflows:

3. **`network-infrastructure.yml`** - Unified network deployment
   - Supports both AWS and Azure
   - Automated VPC/VNet creation and configuration
   - Shared composite actions for consistency

4. **`kubernetes-clusters.yml`** - Unified cluster deployment
   - Supports both AKS (Azure) and EKS (AWS)
   - Parallel cluster deployment
   - Intelligent dependency checking
   - Matrix-based multi-cluster support

5. **`k8s-addons-terraform.yml`** - Kubernetes addons deployment
   - Terraform-managed addon installation
   - Supports cert-manager, external-dns, ingress controllers
   - Cross-cloud DNS integration (Route53 from Azure)
   - Comprehensive validation and monitoring

6. **`platform-engineering.yml`** - Platform engineering stack
   - Backstage service catalog deployment
   - Crossplane infrastructure engine
   - GitOps integration with ArgoCD
   - Component-based deployment strategy

### **🔧 Utility Layer** (3 workflows)
Supporting workflows for validation and builds:

7. **`docker-build.yml`** - Reusable Docker build workflow
   - Multi-registry support
   - Cloud authentication integration
   - Optimized caching strategies

8. **`k8s-validate.yml`** - Kubernetes cluster validation
   - Health checks and connectivity tests
   - Provider abstraction layer
   - Comprehensive validation suite

9. **`tf-validate.yml`** - Terraform configuration validation
   - Syntax and formatting validation
   - Backend configuration verification
   - Detailed summary reporting

## 🏆 **Key Improvements After Refactoring**

### **Eliminated Redundancy**
- **Before**: 19 workflows with significant duplication
- **After**: 9 focused workflows (53% reduction)
- **Removed**: Individual cloud provider workflows, experimental reusable workflows, analysis files

### **Enhanced Capabilities**
- ✅ **Intelligent Orchestration**: Dependency resolution with parallel execution
- ✅ **Environment Promotion**: Automated promotion with approval gates
- ✅ **Unified Cloud Support**: Single workflows handle both AWS and Azure
- ✅ **Shared Components**: Composite actions eliminate code duplication
- ✅ **Comprehensive Validation**: Enhanced error handling and reporting

### **Improved Maintainability**
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: Each capability has one authoritative workflow
- ✅ **Standardized Terraform**: Version 1.9.8 across all workflows
- ✅ **Consistent Patterns**: Shared composite actions and conventions
- ✅ **Better Documentation**: Comprehensive usage guides and troubleshooting

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **Deploy Full Environment**
```bash
gh workflow run "Infrastructure Orchestrator" \
  --field target_environment=dev \
  --field components="network,clusters,addons" \
  --field action=apply \
  --field cloud_provider=azure
```

### **Promote Environment**
```bash
gh workflow run "Environment Promotion" \
  --field source_environment=dev \
  --field target_environment=staging \
  --field components="network,clusters,addons" \
  --field cloud_provider=azure \
  --field auto_approve=true
```

### **Deploy Individual Components**
```bash
# Network only
gh workflow run "Network Infrastructure" \
  --field cloud_provider=azure \
  --field action=apply \
  --field environment=dev

# Specific cluster
gh workflow run "Kubernetes Clusters" \
  --field cloud_provider=azure \
  --field action=apply \
  --field environment=dev \
  --field cluster_name=aks-msdp-dev-01
```
