# MSDP Development Acceleration Setup

## 🎯 Goal
Eliminate the need to build and push Docker images every time you make code changes during development.

## 🛠️ Tools Overview

### 1. **Skaffold** (Recommended)
- **Purpose**: Continuous development for Kubernetes applications
- **Benefits**: Hot reload, automatic rebuilds, port forwarding
- **Best for**: Full development lifecycle automation

### 2. **Tilt** 
- **Purpose**: Multi-service development environment
- **Benefits**: Real-time updates, dependency management, web UI
- **Best for**: Complex microservice development

### 3. **Azure Container Apps** (Serverless)
- **Purpose**: Serverless container development
- **Benefits**: No cluster management, automatic scaling, easy deployment
- **Best for**: Individual service development

### 4. **GitHub Codespaces**
- **Purpose**: Cloud-based development environment
- **Benefits**: Pre-configured environment, VS Code in browser
- **Best for**: Consistent development environment

## 🏆 **Recommended: Skaffold Setup**

Skaffold is the best choice for your MSDP Kubernetes development because:
- ✅ Automatic image building and deployment
- ✅ Hot reload for Node.js applications
- ✅ Port forwarding automation
- ✅ Works with your existing AKS cluster
- ✅ Supports multiple services simultaneously
