## 🔄 **Smart Deployment Integration**

### **Branch-Driven Deployment**
- **`dev` branch** → Development environment
- **`test` branch** → Test environment
- **`prod` branch** → Production environment

### **GitHub Actions Workflow**
- **Automatic deployment** on push to branches
- **Manual deployment** via workflow dispatch
- **Environment detection** based on branch
- **Secrets management** through smart deployment system

## 📁 **Directory Structure Details**

### **`environments/`** - Environment Configurations
- **Purpose**: Environment-specific values and configurations
- **Usage**: Referenced by applications and components
- **Format**: YAML files with environment-specific overrides

### **`components/`** - Reusable Components
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure components that can be reused
- **Contents**: Crossplane XRDs, ArgoCD projects, Helm charts
- **Usage**: Referenced by applications and platforms

### **`platforms/`** - Platform Services
- **Purpose**: Platform-level services (networking, security, monitoring)
- **Contents**: Ingress controllers, certificates, monitoring stack
- **Usage**: Deployed once per cluster

### **`applications/`** - Application Deployments
- **Purpose**: Application-specific deployments
- **Contents**: Backstage, ArgoCD, Crossplane installations
- **Usage**: Deployed per environment

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **1. Deploy Infrastructure**
```bash
# Deploy to development
git push origin dev

# Deploy to test
git push origin test

# Deploy to production
git push origin prod
```

### **2. Manual Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy specific components
helm upgrade --install backstage ./infrastructure/applications/backstage \
  --namespace backstage-dev \
  --values ./infrastructure/environments/dev/values.yaml
```

### **3. Platform Services**
```bash
# Deploy networking
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/platforms/networking/

# Deploy security
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/platforms/security/

# Deploy monitoring
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/platforms/monitoring/
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Management**

### **Environment Variables**
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/msdp-platform/msdp-devops-infrastructure`
- **Environments**: `dev`, `test`, `prod`
- **Naming**: Consistent across all components

### **Secrets Management**
- **Database passwords**: Managed by Crossplane
- **GitHub tokens**: Injected by smart deployment
- **SSL certificates**: Managed by cert-manager

## 📊 **Benefits of Consolidation**

### **✅ Eliminated Issues**
- **No more duplications**: Single source of truth for each component
- **Consistent naming**: All components use same conventions
- **Aligned architecture**: Everything follows smart deployment system
- **Clear structure**: Easy to understand and maintain

### **🚀 Improved Efficiency**
- **Faster deployments**: No conflicting configurations
- **Easier maintenance**: Single location for each component
- **Better testing**: Consistent environment configurations
- **Reduced confusion**: Clear separation of concerns
