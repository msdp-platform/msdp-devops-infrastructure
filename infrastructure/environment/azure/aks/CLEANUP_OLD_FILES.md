# Old Files Removed

The following old files have been removed as part of the fresh setup:

- `locals.tf` - Old complex logic, replaced with simple data sources in main.tf
- `network.tf` - Network logic moved to main.tf
- `cleanup.sh` - No longer needed

The new clean implementation uses:
- `main.tf` - All resources and data sources
- `variables.tf` - Input variables
- `outputs.tf` - Output values
- `versions.tf` - Terraform and provider versions
